# My Reads App

Welcome to the My Reads App! With this application, you'll be provided with a set library of books that you can update to your heart's content! You have the choice between "Currently Reading," "Want to Read," and "Have Read" to designate your position to the book you're arranging. You can also search for and add new books should you feel you need more reading. Should you decide to search, be sure to read the [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md) file to see what terms you can use.

## To get started:

* Verify you're in the root directory for the app and install all project dependencies with `npm i`
* Start the development server with `npm start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Motivations

This project was part of my React Nanodegree coursework with [Udacity](https://udacity.com/). The style is a bit different from the original, but the overall look and functionality has not changed in general from the source code. Thanks for stopping by!
